## 1. Download and install
Download Daedalus wallet using the links at the top of the page or make sure you have **version 2.0.0 or newer than 2.0.1** downloaded or installed. Install the wallet like you would any other application on your computer.

Once installed, start Daedalus and keep it running until the initial synchronization is done. **This can take time** as this is a full-node wallet having whole Cardano chain download locally on your computer. Chain storage will consume aroung **5 GB** of your hard-drive space.

## 2. Restore
When the wallet is fully synchronized you will have couple of button available, click **Restore**
